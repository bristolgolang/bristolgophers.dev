### [AJ Bell](https://www.ajbell.co.uk/)

The Touch team at AJ Bell is developing a next generation investment platform. We want to use technology to improve the way consumers access financial advice and manage their investments. 

The majority of existing platforms are still reliant on software and processes that aren’t capable of supporting today’s technology, so we started from scratch, developing a modern platform that is as efficient as possible. We're building a mobile first investment  app that lets advisers manage their clients' investments entirely through their Smartphone.
